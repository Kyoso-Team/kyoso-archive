# Workflow

When working on anything, whether that is a new feature or fixing a bug, create a branch from `master` for the specific use case. For example: I want to improve performance on something, so the branch could be named something like `improve-performance`. For small, simple and/or automated tasks, like fix a small typo or formatting the project, the `master` branch can be committed to directly (preferably ask Mario564 before doing so).

When you're done with the branch that you're working on, file a pull request, describe why the pull request was made and request a review from Mario564 so he can come in and point out any possible issues and/or improvements, otherwise he'll approve and merge it with `master`.
